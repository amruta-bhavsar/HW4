My second idea is to create a small game where you can pick from various options and create your own ice cream sundae. You would be able to choose the flavor of ice cream, which sauce to put on top,  any toppings, and what kind of bowl or cone it would be served in. The animations and sounds would come into effect once you click and choose each option, and once you've finished creating your sundae, you can restart the game.
